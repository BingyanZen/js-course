## Columbia Course in Advanced Javascript, Spring 2014

This repo was created using hub and the following commands ([for more on hub, a tool created to help you win at git](http://github.com/github/hub))

(mcd is a shortcut command for mkdir [dirName] && cd [dirName])

```sh
$ mcd js-course
$ hub init
$ touch README.md
$ hub add . && hub commit -m "initial commit"
$ hub create [optional_organization_name]/[repo_name] -d "[repo_description]"
$ hub push origin master
```

### Repo Dotfiles:

1. **.editorconfig**
  .editorconfig is used to define a consistent coding style across editors and IDEs (in terms of tab style (tab or spaces), tab width, character set, etc.).  To use this with your editor or IDE, simply go to http://editorconfig.org/ and, under "Download a Plugin", click on your editor/IDE.  Not all of these links are actual downloads.  For example, the Sublime Text icon will take you to the editorcongif plugin for Sublime Text repo page.  This is because Sublime Text has a package installer built in (you can access it with ctrl+shift+p and then typing package and clicking on Package Control: Install Package and searching for and installing editorconfig - Sublime Text will handle the rest for you).

2. **.gitignore**
  almost every large project has directories and specific files that should not be tracked by git.  For example, temp files that are generated by editors like vim and represent previous file state, files that are built automatically using a build tool and should always be generated automatically, or files that contain sensitive information (like API keys) and should not be exposed in a repo.
